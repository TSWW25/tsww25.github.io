        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The issue of online violence against women and girls has reached critical levels globally, affecting safety, mental health, and social participation in digital spaces. From hateful content and the misuse of emerging technologies like deepfakes to the reinforcement of gender bias in AI systems, women face significant risks online. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop aims to review progress in technology combating online violence against women, identify persistent barriers, and propose solutions to emerging challenges. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detection and prevention of gender-based online violence (e.g., harassment, stalking, cyberbullying)</li>
          <li>Sentiment and emotion analysis in abusive or harmful online interactions towards women</li>
          <li>Gender bias identification and mitigation in AI </li>
          <li>Human-centered approaches for online safety applications</li>
          <li>Approaches to preventing, understanding, identifying and mitigating online harms faced by women with multiple marginalised identities (e.g., misogynoir, LGBTQ+ women, or women from religious or cultural minorities)</li>
          <li>Analysis of tracking devices, surveillance tools, and hidden cameras misused against women</li>
          <li>Detection and mitigation of non-consensual deepfake generation and dissemination</li>
          <li>Interdisciplinary approaches to identifying and addressing online harm</li>
          <li>Legal and ethical frameworks for protecting women online</li>
          <li>Psychological, social, and legal impacts of online technology when used for gender-based abuse</li>
        </ul>
