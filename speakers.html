            <h2>Olga Jurasz</h2>
            <p>Professor Olga Jurasz is professor of law at the Open University (UK) and Director of the Centre for Protecting Women Online - an interdisciplinary unit focusing on research, policy engagement and creating social impact in relation to women's online safety. Her research expertise is in international law, human rights, legal responses to violence against women (including online violence) and feminist approaches to governance of online spaces and online safety. Since 2024, she serves as an Independent Expert to the Council of Europe Committee of Experts on combating technology-facilitated violence against women and girls.
                Professor Jurasz is a leading voice in the field of law & violence against women. She published her research widely, including two books: Online Misogyny as a Hate Crime: A Challenge for Legal Regulation (Routledge 2019) and Violence Against Women, Hate and Law: Perspectives from Contemporary Scotland (2022). In 2023, Professor Jurasz led on a project 'Online Violence Against Women: A Four Nations Study' which is the biggest empirical study in the UK to gather data about societal attitudes towards online violence against women and women's experiences of such violence. </p>
            <p>Professor Jurasz's expertise has been used by governments, international organisations and third sector organisations to influence changes in law and policy in areas of online violence against women, criminal law, online communications and State obligations concerning violence against women.  Professor Jurasz provided expert advice to the Council of Europe regarding the development of the first recommendation on the digital dimension of violence against women by GREVIO - the Council of Europe’s independent expert body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.</p>
